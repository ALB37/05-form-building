# Code 301 Lab 04 Templating

**Andrew Bloom and Phelan Carey**
**Version 1.0.3**

## Overview
Our goal with this project was to optimize the structure of our HTML and JS in our ongoing blog site with the inclusion of Handlebars.js, and to improve our skills with refactoring Arrow Functions.

## Getting Started
1. Andrew forked the Instructors' repo for this lab, added Phelan as a collaborator, created the andrew-phelan branch, and we cloned this repo to our local machines.
2. With Andrew driving and Phelan navigating, we reviewed the User Stories, then reviewed the code briefly to wrap our heads around it, then proceeded to dispatch 3/4 TODOs.
3. We synched changes, Phelan created the phelan-andrew branch, completed the final TODO and COMMENT tags, completed documentation, and will now push the final update.

## Architecture
The major change in architecture for this lab is the addition of a Handlebars-based HTML template, and the JS behind the scenes to process it. This includes using curly-bracket Handlebars-linked notation in HTML, and the Handlebars externl library in our JS.

## Change Log

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom and Phelan Carey, based off of source code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. We used the clearfix CSS convention from CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/, the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css and the jQuery v3.2.1 library. CSS code originates from Nicholas Carignan and Rob Reed, further work done by Andrew Bloom and Rob Reed.
