# Code 301 Lab 05 Form Building

**Andrew Bloom**
**Version 1.0.4**

## Overview
1. I forked the initial Lab 05 repo for this lab, cloned it down to my machine and then created the andrew branch.
2. I first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. Next I worked on going through each of the todo and comment sections.
3. 

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and open up the index.html file in your browser.

## Architecture
The major change in architecture for this lab is the addition of a Handlebars-based HTML template, and the JS behind the scenes to process it. This includes using curly-bracket Handlebars-linked notation in HTML, and the Handlebars externl library in our JS.

## Change Log
**No changes currently**

## Credits and Collaborations
Created by Andrew Bloom, based off of source code from the Code Fellows 301 lab repo. Being used is the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css, the handlebars.js v4.11 library and the jQuery v3.2.1 library.
